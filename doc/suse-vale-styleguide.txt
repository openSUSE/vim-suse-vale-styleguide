                                            *suse-vale-styleguide-installation*
I recommend using a plugin manager such as vim-plug
(https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to install and update
vim-suse-vale-styleguide.  If you do not want to use a plugin manager, download
and uncompress the tarball into your ~/.vim/plugin directory.

                                            *suse-vale-styleguide-requirements*
